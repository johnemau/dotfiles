# This is a basic gitconfig template that includes some bare minimums for
# interacting with git in a workspace.  The content between <Angle Brackets>
# in this file must be replaced with values appropriate to you.  This can 
# Be done manually or with the following series of commands run from the current
# folder:
#
#  $ HOME=$(pwd) git config --global user.name "Bits the Dog"
#  $ HOME=$(pwd) git config --global user.email "bits@datadoghq.com"
#  $ HOME=$(pwd) git config --global user.signingkey "$(git config --global user.signingkey)"

[user]
        # The name you want to appear as the author of your commits
        name = John Emau
	# The e-mail address that is associated to the author of your commits
        email = john.emau@datadoghq.com
# This next section is optional and can be omitted if you do not use ssh git
# commit signing.  However, doing so is highly encouraged, and if you have not
# started using this workflow, see the onboarding docs for that:

#         # This is an ssh key that can be used to sign your commits, it should
#         # be made available to your workspace via ssh agent forwarding and can be
#         # seen on your laptop by issuing `git config --global user.signingkey`
